AWS:

VPC:
By default aws provided one vpc in every region.
This default vpc will have 
    3 Subnets (Depends on Availability Zone of that region)
    1 Security Group
    1 NACL (Associated with all subnets)
    1 Route table (Associated with all subnets) (Route table will also have an entry to provide internet access to subnets)
    1 Internet Gateway

When new VPC is created, below resources will be created by default
    1 Security Group
    1 NACL
    1 Route Table
If any new subnet is created and no route table is associated to the newly created subnet explicitly, then the subnet will have main route table as default route table.

1 VPC can have only 1 Internet Gateway


NAT Gateway: 
It is used to provide internet access to ec2 instances in the private subnet.

Inorder to provide internt access to ec2 instances in private subnet, follow the steps below
    Create NAT Gateway in the public subnet.
    Create a route table and associate it to the private subnet.
    Route table should have an entry to forward internet requests to NAT gateway.

We can have more than 1 NAT Gateway for high availability. 1 NAT gateway in each availability zone.
